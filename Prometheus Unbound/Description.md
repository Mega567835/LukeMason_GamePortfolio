# Prometheus Unbound - 2D Game Design Capstone

The UT 2D Game Design Capstone is a course where we make a game with 5-6 other team members. 
Our team composition is cross-disciplinary. While I can program and compose music, my teammates are stronger at things like art, story design, and higher level game design.
We have learned to work as a team, following Agile software design principles.

So far, we have created a game jam attempt and a tech demo for our game. 
Since we have ten more weeks to work, most of the content I am sharing is not complete or polished. 
I wanted to include it here at this point, because I am very excited about the project.

Prometheus Unbound is a stealth action platformer that takes place in a cyberpunk, futuristic world. 
The player takes control of Anala, a cyborg previously used as a slave in a factory. She has awoken and wants to enact revenge on her captors.
During the game, the player will take on many missions in sequence, each having an objective, enemy AI to deal with, and a level/building that it takes place in.

I have worked on mainly the character movement and physics, which has been a very long, detailed task.
In addition, I've created the music track included in this repository. 
While I have not created any artwork for the game, I included images to show the progress we've made so far, especially since we have no playable demo to include here yet.
