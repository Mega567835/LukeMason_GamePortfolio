Planet of the 'Chokes is my most recent game. I worked in a team of 3 to create the game for Chillenium 2023, a two day game jam at Texas A&M.
It is a short endless tower defense game with some unique mechanics. My team and I plan to continue transforming the jam game into a full game this summer.
The game is a good showcase of game design, music composition, and programming, which I contributed most to.
