# LukeMason_GamePortfolio

This portfolio contains three different game projects. Alongside each project, I will include images to give a feel for the game, music I am proud of, and code snippets.

After, I am including a resume since this portfolio is submitted to apply to UT's 2D game design capstone course.
I am interested in working on game design and programming for the course, and I would love to lend a hand in music design as well.
Additional note: I am currently enrolled in UT's C S 354H, honors computer graphics. I was told it would act as a prerequisite for the game design capstone.

More information is included on the game page for projects 1 and 3, and I have a youtube video for project 2 that I created as part of the submission.
I apologize for not having a full portfolio website, as I did not have enough time to create one! Hopefully this folder is easy to navigate.
