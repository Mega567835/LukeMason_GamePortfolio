# LukeMason_GamePortfolio

This portfolio contains four different game projects. Alongside the unity projects, I'll include images, music, and code. 
Since music and images don't display well in github, here is a drive link containing the portfolio:

In addition, each project has a description file in its folder, as well as a description for each code sample.

As for the PvZ recreation, I do not have the circuit built anymore, but I've included the submission videos I created with the game and some code.
