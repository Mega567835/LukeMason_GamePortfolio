# LukeMason_GamePortfolio

This portfolio contains three different game projects. Alongside each project, I will include images to give a feel for the game, music I am proud of, and code snippets.

After, I am including a resume since this portfolio is submitted to apply to UT's 2D game design capstone course.
I am interested in working on game design and programming for the course, and I would love to lend a hand in music design as well.
Additional note: I am currently enrolled in UT's C S 354H, honors computer graphics. I was told it would act as a prerequisite for the game design capstone.

Here is a short description of each project:

1)  Planet of the 'Chokes is my most recent game. I worked in a team of 3 to create the game for Chillenium 2023, a two day game jam at Texas A&M.
It is a short endless tower defense game with some unique mechanics. My team and I plan to continue transforming the jam game into a full game this summer.
The game is a good showcase of game design, music composition, and programming, which I contributed most to.

2)  TM4C Plants Vs. Zombies was a game sumbission to the UT ECE game competition, designed with one partner over the course of two weeks.
We were tasked with recreating an existing game and finding out how to adapt it to an arduino-like microcontroller and drive our own LCD Display.
While I obviously did not come up with any game concepts, I recreated the gameplay loops to work in my version of the game.
The game is a great showcase of programming and certain game design decisions I had to make.

3)  Finding Mother, while lacking in title creativity, is a full length puzzle platformer. 
This was created as a submission to a two week game jam during quarantine with a few other creators.
In this game, I worked on game design, programming, level design, some music, and pixel art/animation for characters.
Overall, I am proud of the game concept and the design I created for it.
