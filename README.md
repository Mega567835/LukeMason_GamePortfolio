# LukeMason_GamePortfolio

This portfolio contains three different game projects. Alongside the two unity projects, I'll include images, music, and code. 
In addition, each project has a description file in its folder, as well as a description for each code sample.

As for the PvZ recreation, I do not have the circuit built anymore, but I've included the submission videos I created with the game and some code.

After, I am including a resume since this portfolio is submitted to apply to UT's 2D game design capstone course.
I am interested in working on game design and programming for the course, and I would love to lend a hand in music design as well.
Additional note: I am currently enrolled in UT's C S 354H, honors computer graphics. I was told it would act as a prerequisite for the game design capstone.

I apologize for not having a full portfolio website, as I did not have enough time to create one.
I have never made a game portfolio before, so I am hoping this is easy to navigate!
Have a good one.
