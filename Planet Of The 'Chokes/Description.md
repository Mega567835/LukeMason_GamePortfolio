# Planet of the 'Chokes - Game Jam Entry

Game page: https://wild-mortimer.itch.io/planet-of-the-chokes

Planet of the 'Chokes is my most recent game. I worked in a team of 3 to create the game for Chillenium 2023, a two day game jam at Texas A&M.
It is a short tower defense game with some unique mechanics. My team and I plan to continue transforming the jam game into a full game this summer.
The game is a good showcase of game design, music composition, and programming, which I contributed most to.

The theme of the game jam was "We share a heart," so we created a planet tower defense game where you have to save the planet from aliens while combatting global warming.
In addition, we made the currency of the game artichokes, to relate to the heart theme. More thematic stretches can be seen on the game page.

One cool game mechanic is being able to build towers in a binary tree like pattern, in order to better protect lower towers. 
Global warming is a main issue while fighting aliens, so the player has to account for that with anti-global warming measures, such as carbon trappers and green energy.

The game is "endless," so there is no end unless you lose. We made the difficulty cap at about four minutes, since we anticipated the judges not reaching that point.
We will be sure to include different levels and more game mechanics when we continue work on the game.

We ended up getting second place in programming. (There were 56 entries)
