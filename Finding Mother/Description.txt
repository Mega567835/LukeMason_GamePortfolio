Finding Mother, while lacking in title creativity, is a full length puzzle platformer. 
This was created as a submission to a two week game jam during quarantine with a few other creators.
In this game, I worked on game design, programming, level design, some music, and pixel art/animation for characters.
Overall, I am proud of the game concept and the design I created for it.

The game is a click and drag platformer where you launch crabs to clear obstacles and defeat enemies.
In addition, crabs stack on top of each other to reach higher places.
Many crabs have unique abilities, allowing for further puzzle and gameplay mechanics.
The crab/baseball theming was due to the game jam being for the Baltimore Crabs, a Blaseball team (Sorta fantasy baseball).

I created all of the levels for the game, and created two of the four music tracks as well. I have included them in this directory.
This is the first game I have ever made in unity, so I learned many new aspects of game creation through this project.
