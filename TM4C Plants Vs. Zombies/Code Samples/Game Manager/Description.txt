GameManager.cpp contains the high level behavior of the game, including rendering and time ticking.
The scene contains lists of game objects in different categories.
All game objects inherit what to do on a time update, and mark if they need to be re-rendered in the scene.
Much more initialization and code was excluded from GameManager for this portfolio.

Game.h contains all the headers for the gameplay in the project. I understood that this was not great practice,
but I was running into an issue with the board drivers and circular dependencies, so I found it easiest to combine the headers.
