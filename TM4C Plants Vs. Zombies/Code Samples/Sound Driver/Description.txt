DAC.h and DAC.cpp contain the funtionality for the sound effects for our game.
Since the game was run on a microcontroller, we had to write the sound driver, including outputting voltages to a board.
We had a speaker on the board that would output the sound effects.
The board has an SD card on it, so we were able to store the effects there before loading them during initialization of the game.
