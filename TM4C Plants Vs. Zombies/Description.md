TM4C Plants Vs. Zombies was a game sumbission to the UT ECE embedded systems game competition, designed with one partner over the course of two weeks.
The game was required to run on a TM4C microcontroller, which created interesting challenges to running the game.
We were tasked with recreating an existing game and finding out how to adapt it to the microcontroller and drive our own LCD Display.
While I obviously did not come up with any game concepts, I recreated the gameplay loops to work in my version of the game.
The game is a great showcase of programming and certain game design decisions I had to make.
Also, we won!

We also had to wire up the breadboard with controls, power, and the serial bus for the screen, among other things.
I don't have the game physically built anymore, and I cannot take any pictures of it now, so hopefully you find the submission videos useful!

In terms of music and sound design, we were able to include some sound effects.
However, we didn't have time to create a DMA driver for the TM4C, so music wasn't able to work out.
Even though that's hardly related to game design, I thought it was worth mentioning.
