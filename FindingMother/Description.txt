Finding Mother, while lacking in title creativity, is a full length puzzle platformer. 
This was created as a submission to a two week game jam during 2021 quarantine with a few other creators.
In this game, I worked on game design, programming, level design, some music, and pixel art/animation for characters.
Overall, I am proud of the game concept and the design I created for it.
